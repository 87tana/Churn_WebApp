## Frontend app with Streamlit

The web app is composed of multiple tabs/interfaces that achieve the different Machine Learning steps manually by the user, relying on the pre-built UI components (e.g for data pre-processing, for configuring the ML model parameters, training,...)

You can see the app in the browser using this URL: 
## Backend app with FASTAPI

FastAPI is a python web framework which I used to implement the APIs for this web application.
